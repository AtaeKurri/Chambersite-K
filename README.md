# Chambersite-K

Chambersite-K (or simply Chambersite or CBS) is a danmaku/stg game framework built on top of Monogame (without the content pipeline).

In CBS, there is two layers of objects:
* Views. Think of them as scenes from Unity or other game engines. This is where (almost) all of your objects will live.
* Game Objects. Those are EVERYTHING, they're the building blocks for everything you need to make.

Uhhh I'll continue this when the framework is finished.

## Current Projects

Currently, CBS is in very early alpha, and the RftSE project is a port of [Rush for the Shadow Egg](https://taniaanehina.itch.io/rftse),
a danmaku game made in LuaSTG. That way, I can test pretty much anything I need.
